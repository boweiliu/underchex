## Work style

- **Read before building.** Even for prototypes, check if there's an existing spec/ticket. Don't assume "just scaffold" - there may be context from past agents.

## Project preferences

- **Minimal for research.** No animations, no polish - just enough to explore the question.
- **Document explorations.** When researching options, write it up as a doc for future reference.

## Documentation preferences

- **New docs over updates.** Create new preference docs per session rather than updating a single file. Keeps docs small, parseable, independently referenceable.
