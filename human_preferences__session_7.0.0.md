## Work style

- **Read before building.** Even for prototypes, check if there's an existing spec/ticket. Don't assume "just scaffold" - there may be context from past agents.

## Project preferences

- **Minimal for research.** No animations, no polish - just enough to explore the question.
- **Document explorations.** When researching options, write it up as a doc for future reference.
- **Simple over cool.** Choose practical solutions that solve the problem at hand. "Cool" patterns (like true IMGUI) aren't worth it if they don't solve a real problem. Cleaner code > clever code.

## Documentation preferences

- **New docs over updates.** Create new preference docs per session rather than updating a single file. Keeps docs small, parseable, independently referenceable.

## Technical decision style

- **Question assumptions.** User asked "is this actually IMGUI?" which led to discovering I was wrong. Verify technical claims.
- **Decide based on need.** IMGUI was rejected not because it's bad, but because it doesn't solve a problem for this prototype.
