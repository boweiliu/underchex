# Gemini Context - UNDERCHEX

UNDERCHEX is a hex-chess variant design + implementation repo. Primary goals:
1) Playable 2-player hex chess.
2) Rules are easy to tweak (board size, piece moves, starting layout).
3) Chess AI with search + evaluation, plus self-play tooling.

Key locations:
- `src/` implementations in multiple languages (TS/JS, Python, Kotlin, C, Rust, etc.).
- `spec/` and design notes.

Agent workflow notes:
- Follow `AGENTS.md` for repo-specific agent rules (nb usage, commits, signoffs).
- LLM-generated docs should be labeled with LLMS_ or *.llms.md (see README).
