# Worklog Details - Doc DB Discoverability for NB Visual

Tags: #worklog-details #documentation #nb-visual #search

## Motivation
- The human asked for a retro focused on how the doc database itself could be improved to make future searches more effective.

## What Changed
- Rewrote the retro for Agent 48.1 to focus on doc database gaps and concrete discoverability improvements.
- Corrected duplicate H1 in the retro and normalized signoff harness to `via codex`.

## How It Works
- The retro now calls out missing hubs and indices, plus inconsistent backlinking as the primary root causes of repeated searches.
- It recommends adding a dedicated NB Visual hub, a Worklog Details index, a tag index for popular search terms, and a standard Related Notes block to improve link density.
