Tags: #project #underchex #status #refactor

## Overview

As of 2026-02-04, the Underchex project is undergoing a "nuke and refactor" phase.

## What's Being Kept

- **Basic game concepts**: The core hex chess variant design (6-way adjacency downgrade from 8-way)
- **Piece designs**: Pawns, Kings, Queens, Knights/Elephants, Lances, Chariots
- **Research and documentation**: Knowledge accumulated about the game design

## What's Being Reconsidered

- All existing implementation code
- Project structure and architecture
- Build systems and tooling
- Multi-language implementation approach
