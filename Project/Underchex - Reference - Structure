# Project/Underchex - Reference - Structure
Tags: #project #underchex #reference #structure #project-structure

## Overview


## Conventions
- spec/: Language-agnostic game rules and test cases. All implementations should pass the shared tests.
- src/{lang}/: Each implementation is self-contained with its own build system. AI engines are implemented per-project.
- Interoperability: Implementations should be able to communicate (protocol TBD).

## Files Created
### spec/rules.md
Game rules extracted from README:
- Board: Hexagonal grid with 6-way adjacency (N, S, NE, NW, SE, SW)
- Pieces: Pawns, Kings, Queens, Knights (Elephants), Lances, Chariots
- Movement patterns documented for each piece type

### spec/board.json
Board definition placeholder with:
- Grid type: hexagonal
- Adjacency directions: N, S, NE, NW, SE, SW
- Size: TBD based on playtesting

### spec/pieces.json
Piece definitions including:
- Pawn: moves N, captures N/NE/NW (Chinese chess inspired forward capture)
- King: 1 square in any of 6 directions
- Queen: kingrider (unlimited range in 6 directions)
- Knight: elephant-like, 3 colors, diagonal leaper
- Lance: 4-way rider (N, S, NW-SW, NE-SE), 2 colors
- Chariot: 4-way diagonal rider (NE, NW, SE, SW)

### spec/tests/move_validation.json
Shared test case format for cross-implementation validation. Example test case structure provided.

### src/{lang}/.gitkeep
Empty placeholder directories for each planned implementation.
