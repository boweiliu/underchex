## New Observations

### Design Philosophy

- **Domain semantics over generic elegance.** When choosing hex coordinates, prioritized chess-specific meaning (N/S as forward/backward) over mathematically "cleaner" systems. The coordinate system should reflect the game's semantics, not abstract grid theory.

- **Simple > Familiar.** Rejected a hybrid abstraction that would preserve "familiar" column numbers in favor of a simpler raw representation. No point optimizing for familiarity when there are no existing users.

- **Investigate options, then decide.** Asked for a writeup of all options before making a decision. Wants to see the landscape, not just a recommendation.

### Working Style

- **Docs for review.** Prefers agent writes up investigation as a doc, then user reviews and decides. Not "agent decides and implements."

- **Record decisions explicitly.** After making a decision, wants it captured in docs with rationale.

- **Session artifacts.** Wants diary + humanprefs docs to summarize sessions. Values institutional memory.
