- Start Codex in full auto mode when needed:
  - `codex --ask-for-approval never`
  - `codex --full-auto`
- If Codex asks for approval unexpectedly, verify config keys are correct:
  - `approval_policy` (not `approval_mode`)
  - `sandbox_mode` (not `sandbox`)
- Repo trust and other details live in the LLM README summary.
