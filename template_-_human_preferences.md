## When to use

- Create one doc per user/human you work with
- Update it when you observe new preferences
- Link to it from diary entries

## Guidance

- Be specific: "prefers 1-line tickets" not "likes concise docs"
- Include evidence: what did they say/do that revealed this?
- Distinguish preferences from one-time requests
- Update, don't duplicate - one living doc per person
