# NB - Debug - MD Trailer in List

Tags: #debug #naming

## Problem
`nb list` shows `.md` extension for some notes but not others, making the list look inconsistent.

## Cause
`nb list` displays the **H1 heading** from the file content, not the filename. When a note lacks an H1 heading, nb falls back to showing the raw filename (including `.md`).

## Example
- Note with `# NB - Hub` heading → displays as `NB - Hub`
- Note without H1 heading, filename `NB - Hub.md` → displays as `NB - Hub.md`

## Solution
Ensure every note has an H1 heading as the first line that follows the naming convention:
```markdown
# Topic - Doc Type - Specific

Tags: #tag1 #tag2

## Content starts here
```
