Retros are written incrementally and saved to the docs/ folder, but each retro ends with an explicit backmatter completion signature that signals the document is finished. A PostToolUse(write) hook monitors file writes and filters for retro files; it ignores intermediate writes and only triggers once it detects the completion marker and confirms the retro has not already been processed.

When that condition is met, the hook spawns a separate, headless Claude Code session whose sole responsibility is to read the completed retro and translate it into a reusable Claude Code skill. After the skill is successfully generated, the system updates the original retro with a processed/skill-generated marker, ensuring the workflow is idempotent and preventing duplicate skill creation even if the file is modified or rewritten later.
