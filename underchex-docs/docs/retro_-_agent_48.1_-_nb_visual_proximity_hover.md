# Retro - Agent 48.1 - NB Visual Proximity Hover

Tags: #retro #worklog #nb-visual #hover #agent-48

## Scope
- Reviewed Agent 48.1 worklog + worklog details and the tool-call log.
- Browsed NB hub/indices and tag guidance to assess discoverability.

## Doc Database Gaps (Impacting Discoverability)
- NB Visual knowledge is spread across many worklog-detail notes, but there is no dedicated “NB Visual Index” hub to aggregate them by topic (hover, tags, layout, build pipeline).
- Worklogs Index only lists worklogs; it does not link to worklog details or common “how-to” notes, so agents must guess searches.
- Tagging guidance exists, but there is no tag index or “popular tags” landing page to route searches (e.g., #nb-visual, #hover, #d3).
- Several docs reference note numbers in passing without consistent backlinks or a breadcrumb section (e.g., “See also / related” lists are uneven).

## Improvements to Make Search More Efficient
- Add `NB Visual - Hub` with sections for interaction (hover/labels), data formats, build pipeline, and troubleshooting; link it from `Project/Underchex - Hub` and `NB - Hub`.
- Extend `Worklogs Index` with a short “Worklog Details Index” linking the core NB Visual detail notes (graph builder, hover, tags, layout, JSON formats).
- Create a “Tag Index” or “Popular Tags” note (at least #nb-visual, #hover, #d3, #tags, #layout) with one-line descriptions and links to the best entry docs.
- Standardize a “Related Notes” block for worklog details to ensure consistent backlinks and reduce repeated search passes.
