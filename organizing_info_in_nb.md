## Goal

Create small-sized docs that link to other docs rather than a single big one. Use a hub-and-links approach so the notebook reads like a knowledge base.

## Approach

- Start with a short hub note for a topic (1-2 screens). Link out to focused sub-notes for details.
- Keep each sub-note scoped to one command, workflow, or decision.
- Use consistent titles so links are predictable and search friendly.
- Add #tags to every note so  can find the right entry quickly.

## Structure

1. **Hub note**
   - Purpose, scope, and a short bullet list of linked sub-notes.
   - Example links:
     - [[nb setup]]
     - [[nb search tips]]
     - [[nb sync workflow]]

2. **Sub-notes**
   - One idea per note (ex: a command or workflow).
   - Include short examples and the minimal steps to complete the task.

## Maintenance

- When a hub note grows, split it into new sub-notes and link them back.
- Keep tags fresh when topics evolve.
- Prefer editing existing notes over adding duplicates.
