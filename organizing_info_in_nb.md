# NB - Decision - Knowledge Base Structure

Tags: #knowledge-base #onboarding #workflow

## Goal

Create small-sized docs that link to other docs rather than a single big one. Use a hub-and-links approach so the notebook reads like a knowledge base.

## Approach

- Start with a short hub note for a topic (1-2 screens). Link out to focused sub-notes for details.
- Keep each sub-note scoped to one command, workflow, or decision.
- Use consistent titles so links are predictable and search friendly.
- Add #tags to hub notes. Leaf docs linked from hubs don't need tags (per AGENTS.md - "if the hub has a tag and the hub has a clear link to the doc, the leaf doc doesn't need a tag").

## Structure

1. **Hub note**
   - Purpose, scope, and a short bullet list of linked sub-notes.
   - Example links:
    - [[NB - Guide - Setup]]
    - [[NB - Guide - Search Tips]]
    - [[NB - Guide - Sync Workflow]]

2. **Sub-notes**
   - One idea per note (ex: a command or workflow).
   - Include short examples and the minimal steps to complete the task.

## Maintenance

- When a hub note grows, split it into new sub-notes and link them back.
- Keep tags fresh when topics evolve.
- Prefer editing existing notes over adding duplicates.
