# Worklog - Agent 43 - Cleanup Checklist

Checklist for cleaning up [[Worklog - Agent 43 - C and Elixir Tablebase Tests]].

## Checklist
- Add `Tags: #worklogs` after the H1 if worklogs are expected to be tagged; otherwise confirm it is linked from `Worklogs Index` and keep it tag-less.
- Tighten the Summary to 1-2 bullets; avoid full sentences.
- Collapse "Work Completed" bullets so each item is one line where possible; remove bold emphasis if it is not used consistently elsewhere.
- Normalize list numbering (either `1.` or bullets) across "Priority Work Items" and "Notes on Kotlin".
- Consider moving "Recommendations for Future Agents" to a separate note if it keeps growing; keep the worklog focused on what was done.
- Ensure the test table and counts have a date reference (for example, add "Test results (2026-01-22)").
- In "Test Commands," remove redundant `cd` lines by grouping per language, or add a short "run from repo root" note.
- Verify links are complete and current: `Worklogs Index`, `Project/Underchex - Hub`, and the previous worklog.
