## Work style

- **Read before building.** Check for existing specs/tickets before coding, even for "just scaffold" tasks.
- **Question assumptions.** User will challenge technical claims - verify terms like "IMGUI" before using them.

## Project preferences

- **Minimal for research.** No animations, no polish - just enough to explore the question.
- **Simple over cool.** Choose practical solutions. IMGUI is interesting but doesn't solve a problem for proto-01.
- **Document explorations.** Write up research even for options we don't choose - future agents may need them.

## Documentation preferences

- **New docs over updates.** Create new preference/diary docs per session. Keeps docs small, parseable, independently referenceable.
- **Pull out subdocs.** If adding a large section to a doc, make it a separate doc and link instead.
- **Handoff docs.** At session end, create a next-steps doc and link it from project status. Future agents need clear pickup points.

## Technical decision style

- **Decide based on need.** "Does this solve a problem for us?" not "Is this cool?"
- **Rationale matters.** Document why we chose something, not just what.
