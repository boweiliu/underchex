Observed preferences for working with this user. Update as you learn more.

## Communication style

- **Concise over verbose.** Dense information preferred. "1 line per ticket" not "multi-paragraph descriptions."
- **Direct correction.** They give clear feedback ("your assumptions are incorrect"). No need to hedge; they'll tell you when you're wrong.
- **Editable outputs.** "Put it in a doc and I'll edit" - provide artifacts they can modify, not final pronouncements.

## Work style

- **Research mindset.** Exploring a design space, not executing a known plan. Unknowns are the work, not blockers to the work.
- **Iterative over perfect.** Fast wrong answer that gets corrected > slow right answer. First drafts surface mismatches.
- **Values reflection.** Cares about agent metacognition. Wants to see thinking, not just output.
- **Read before building.** Even for prototypes, check if there's an existing spec/ticket. Don't assume "just scaffold" - there may be context from past agents.

## Project preferences

- **Prototype first.** Build to learn, don't spec then build.
- **Code as spec.** Maybe the implementation IS the specification.
